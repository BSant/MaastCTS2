# MaastCTS2 Experiments Code

This directory contains code that was used to run experiments for Master Thesis and CIG 2016 paper on MaastCTS2. The majority
of this code was written by Torsten Schuster for his experiments in 2015, and changed or added to where necessary by Dennis Soemers in 2016.
This code is only for Single-Player GVGAI, and will likely require changes for Multi-Player GVGAI. 

Note that the ExtendedArcadeMachine.java file is based on a file by the same name in the original GVG-AI framework. The original (framework)
file has been changed numerous times since 2014. The implementation is this directory is based on the 2014 version. Some changes that I noticed
in the framework have also been copied afterwards into this file (especially when it would otherwise refuse to compile), but maybe not all of them.
It may be useful for new users to start out with a fresh copy of latest version of the file in the framework.

The code in this directory is likely to be a bit messy in comparison to the actual agent code, but maybe someone still finds it useful.
